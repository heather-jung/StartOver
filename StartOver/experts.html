      <h1>experts</h1>
      <p>a question and answer (Q&A) app that connects people to experts and provides a platform to share knowledge.</p>

          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Finding answers we need isn’t always as easy as it seems. In fact, a lot of our questions go unanswered for many reasons. Since the process of asking questions and finding answers can be long and frustrating, my goal was to create an app that eliminated factors contributing to an unpleasant experience.
          </p>

          <p>The Experts app reduces factors that contribute to a frustrating experience by providing multiple ways to access experts, allowing experts to prepare their answers in advance, and offering flexible ways to communicate.
          </p>
          <br>


          <h2>Research</h2>
          <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
          <div><img src="img/app_analysis.png" alt="analysis" class="competitiveprofile"></div>
          <p>I created competitor profiles of Just Answers and Askedoo. The three main themes that emerged from my observations were: 
          </p>
          <br>

          <p>
            <strong>Poor Categorization</strong>
            <br>
            I found that the "JustAnswer" app was difficult to navigate because of:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Unalphabetized categories (ex: experts' name or expertise)</li>
            <li>No search engine</li>
            <li>Cluttered information</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Unnecessary Video Calls</strong>
            <br>
            A question that arose was whether or not video calls were necessary.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Simple questions don't require video calls.</li>
            <li>Is it worth paying to use video call?</li>
            <li>Video calls may be uncomfortable.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Hesitant using a Q&A app</strong>
            <br>
            There were some reasons people were hesitant to use a Q&A app, such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Using other methods of obtaining information</li>
            <li>Trustworthiness of experts</li>
            <li>Miscommunication</li>
            <li>Not getting your question answered</li>
            <li>Feeling of not getting your money's worth</li>
          </ul>
          <br>

          <h3>Understanding the User</h3>
          <p>After brainstorming a list of possible problems and solutions that Q&A apps may face, I focused on these three research goals to help me conduct <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/XDCNYW7">user surveys</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aKQdMXWdoeNNtcQKOi7lmN8beUXe1Qcm46mkjC6lgyY/edit">user interviews</a>. ​​​​​​​
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Consider the factors that create a frustrating experience.
            </li>
            <li>Identify the process of how people ask questions and what resources are used.
            </li>
            <li>Determine preferred methods of communication when connecting to experts.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Meet Ryan, Kim, & Greg</h2>
          <p>Behind these three peronas are 26 unique individuals, 6 user interviews, and 20 user surveys conducted. I have created Ryan, Kimberly, and Greg to capture an audience of users’ daily challenges, frustrations, needs, motivations, and attitudes toward getting connected to experts.
          </p>

          </div>
          <br>


          <h2>Narrowing the Scope</h2>
          <p>Based on the previous methodology and findings, I envisoned the experts app to have:</p>
          <h4>Basic Functions
          </h4>
          <p>Providing basic functions, such as finding experts, asking questions, making video calls and payments, are necessary to fulfill the users' basic needs. 
          </p>
          <h4>Strong User Flows
          </h4>
          <p>Strong user flows not only saves time but eliminates frustration and the feeling of being lost when users are completing a task.  
          </p>
          <h4>Everything-You-Need Home Page
          </h4>
          <p>A home page that keeps track of asked questions, saved experts, and upcoming appointments can make users feel organized and creates structure out of potential chaos. 
          </p>
          <h4>Easy Access to Experts
          </h4>
          <p>When users are unable to find the experts they need, the natural response is frustration, which is why providing multiple ways to search for experts is essential.
          </p> 
          <h4>Experts' Credibility
          </h4>
          <p>Displaying the experts' ratings and their credentials clearly are important for increasing user retention and trustworthiness. ​​​​​
          </p>
          <h4>Various Methods of Communication
          </h4>
          <p>Allowing users to choose their method of communication promotes autonomy as they may have their reasons as to why a comment, message, phone call, or video call would be best for them. It can reduce the discomfort of talking to strangers.
          </p> 
          <h4>Ability to Book Appointments
          </h4>
          <p>The ability to book appointments may reduce anticipation time and the feeling of having waited a long time to receive an answer. 
          </p>
          <br>


          <h2>Building the Foundation</h2>
          <h3>Card sorting
          </h3>
          <p>Closed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_bALJgq5lH2xiTOOQZc0GU8KeuqpamYOUIHcwXU-fis/edit">card sorting</a> was conducted on five participants using a physical test. They grouped the product content of 43 cards into the 8 defined categories. The average amount of time spent completing this study was 11.29 minutes.
          </p>
          <h3>Sitemap
          </h3>
          <p>Experts' sitemap is structured to make the experts easily accessible to users through the search bar, home page, and "Experts" page.

          <h2>Usability Test Report</h2>
          <p>After conducting the usability tests, I consolidated the responses onto the Rainbow Sheet and ranked the severity of errors using Jakob Nielson's rating scale. 
          </p>
          <div><img src="img/rainbow.png" alt="rainbow" class="rainbow"></div>
          <h3>Top Five Issues:
          </h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Users were not able to access the search bar on the “Home” page (High).
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Suggested Change: Make the search bar accessible on all the pages.
              </li>
            </ul>
          <li>Users were not able to follow the expert from the “Search Results” page (High).
          </li>
                      <ul>
              <li>Suggested Change: Make the "Follow" button on the "Search Results" page accessible.
              </li>
            </ul>
          <li>Users attempted to sign-up by clicking on the sign-in box (Medium).
          </li>
                                <ul>
              <li>Suggested Change: Create a "Get Started" button and place it under the sign-in box. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          <li>Users varied in the process of how a question is asked. Most users looked for the expert first before asking their question, while other users asked their question first and then looked for an expert (Medium).
          </li>
                                <ul>
              <li>Suggested Change: Change the process of how a question is asked by having the users decide who to ask first and then ask their question. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          <li>Some users had difficulty locating the button to follow an expert (Low).
          </li>
                                <ul>
              <li>Suggested Change: Add coach marks to educate users that experts can be saved and also add color to the "Follow" button.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ol>
          <br>


          <h2>Refining the Design</h2>
          <h3>Preference Test</h3>
          <p>To improve the appearance of the home page, UsabilityHub was used to conduct a preference test.
          </p> ​​​​
          <div><img src="img/preference.png" alt="preference" class="preference"></div>

          <h3>Design Language</h3>
          <p>A style guide was created for experts for future use and to hand-off to developers. 
          </p> ​​​​
          <div><img src="img/style.png" alt="style" class="style"></div>
          <br>


          <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
          <h4>People love Google.
          </h4>
          <p>Google is the best because it gives people autonomy, comfort, and convenience. People like to find answers on their own initiative and timing. Questions don't need to be fully thought out before completing a search. The search can be quick or more extensive, depending on the complexity of the question and what they are looking for.
          </p>
          <h4>A free drink is not a strong incentive to complete a survey.
          </h4>
          <p>Providing an incentive of purchasing a drink for the participant after completion of the tasks isn't necessary since most of my participants did not mind completing the tasks. 
          </p>
          <h4>Emphasis on building community can remove a professional feel. 
          </h4>
          <p>A social platform is created when everyone pitches in their opinion using casual and unfiltered language. Providing various perspectives can come in forms of bias or facts, and it's the facts that create professionalism while biased thoughts can create a social platform.
          </p>
          <h4>Swiping is a natural tendency when people are stuck on a screen.
          </h4>
          <p>When participants are not able to find what they are looking for or do not know how to proceed to the next step, their default mode is to swipe.
          </p>
          <h4>The words "sign-in" and "sign-up" are too similar. 
          </h4>
          <p>I learned that most participants do not read carefully because the "sign-in" box was frequently clicked when creating an account instead of the "sign-up" box. 
          </p>
          <h4>A search icon on every screen is unnecessary and takes up space. 
          </h4>
          <p>I cannot understate the importance of having a search bar as participants naturally gravitate towards it to look up experts or questions. However, the search bar does not need to be on every screen as it may remove the focus off what is currently being displayed.
