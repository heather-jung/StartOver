          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Experts is a question and answer (Q&A) app focusing on connecting people to experts of any field, in a thoughtful and personalized way. The app provides easy access to experts, a way to share knowledge, and a wide range of topics.
          </p>

          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>Enable anyone, anywhere to instantly chat with an expert in virtually any field.
          </p>

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>Finding the answers we need isn’t always as easy as it seems. In fact, a lot of our questions go unanswered for many reasons. Since the process of asking questions and finding answers can be long and frustrating, how can we eliminate factors that contribute to an unpleasant experience?
          </p>

          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>The experts app reduces factors that contribute to a frustrating experience by presenting clear user flows, providing multiple ways to access experts, allowing experts to prepare their answers in advance, and offering flexible ways to communicate.

          <h2><center>Getting to Know Our Competitors</center></h2>
          <p>Though there are several widely-known and used Q&A platforms (ex: Quora, Reddit, Yahoo Answers), I created competitor profiles of Just Answers and Askedoo because these mobile apps connect users to experts through methods of communication that go beyond the means of posting questions and receiving answers.

            <h2><center>Understanding the User</center></h2>
            <p>After conducting a competitive analysis of Just Answers and Askedoo, I brainstormed a list of possible problems and solutions that Q&A apps may face. Using the list of possible problems and solutions, I focused on three research goals, which is supported by the <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/XDCNYW7">user surveys</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aKQdMXWdoeNNtcQKOi7lmN8beUXe1Qcm46mkjC6lgyY/edit">user interviews</a>. ​​​​​​​
            </p>
            <h3>Research Goals</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Consider the factors that create a frustrating experience.
              </li>
              <li>Identify the process of how people ask questions and what resources are used.
              </li>
              <li>Determine preferred methods of communication when connecting to experts.
              </li>

            <h3>Research Takeaways</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>People prefer using Google because it's quick and convenient.
              </li>
              <li>People are open to having various answers to their questions. 
              </li>
              <li>People prefer having multiple methods of communication. 
              </li>
              <li>People find miscommunication to be problematic and unprofessional.
              </li>
              <li>People prefer entering keywords to narrow down their search.

            <h2><center>Meet Ryan, Kim, & Greg</center></h2>
            <div><img src="img/meet.png" alt="meet" class="meet"></div>
            <p>Behind these three peronas are 26 unique individuals, 6 user interviews, and 20 user surveys conducted. I have created Ryan, Kimberly, and Greg to capture an audience of users’ daily challenges, frustrations, needs, motivations, and attitudes toward getting connected to experts.
            </p>
            <p>Following each persona will be a corresponding user journey map and user flow. User journey maps demonstrate the visual process of what Ryan and Kimberly would do and experience as they accomplish a specific goal. User flows display clear pathways for Ryan, Kimberly, and Greg, as they interact with the Expert app to achieve their goals.

            <h2><center>Narrowing the Scope</center></h2>
            <p>Based on the previous methodology and findings, I envisoned the experts app to have:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Basic Functions</b></li>
              <p>Providing basic functions, such as finding experts, asking questions, making video calls and payments, are necessary to fulfill the users' basic needs. 
              </p>
              <li><b>Strong User Flows</b></li>
              <p>Strong user flows not only saves time but eliminates frustration and the feeling of being lost when users are completing a task.  
              </p>
              <li><b>Everything-You-Need Home Page</b></li>
              <p>A home page that keeps track of asked questions, saved experts, and upcoming appointments can make users feel organized and creates structure out of potential chaos. 
              </p>
              <li><b>Easy Access to Experts</b></li>
              <p>When users are unable to find the experts they need, the natural response is frustration, which is why providing multiple ways to search for experts is essential.
              </p> 
              <li><b>Experts' Credibility</b></li>
              <p>Displaying the experts' ratings and their credentials clearly are important for increasing user retention and trustworthiness. ​​​​​
              </p>
              <li><b>Various Methods of Communication</b></li>
              <p>Allowing users to choose their method of communication promotes autonomy as they may have their reasons as to why a comment, message, phone call, or video call would be best for them. It can reduce the discomfort of talking to strangers.
              </p> 
              <li><b>Ability to Book Appointments</b></li>
              <p>The ability to book appointments may reduce anticipation time and the feeling of having waited a long time to receive an answer. 
              </p>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <p><center><b>Here are the top five issues:
            </center></b></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Users were not able to access the search bar on the “Home” page (High).
              </li>
              <p><i>Suggested Change: Make the search bar accessible on all the pages.
              </i></p>

              <li>Users were not able to follow the expert from the “Search Results” page (High).
              </li>
              <p><i>Suggested Change: Make the “follow” button on the “Search Results” page accessible.
              </i></p>
              
              <li>Users attempted to sign-up by clicking on the sign-in box (Medium).
              </li>
              <p><i>Suggested Change: Create a “Get Started” button and place it under the sign-in box. Remove the “sign-up” link that is at the bottom of the screen because it isn’t noticeable.
              </i></p>

              <li>Users varied in the process of how a question is asked. Most users looked for the expert first before asking their question, while other users asked their question first and then looked for an expert (Medium).
              </li>
              <p><i>Suggested Change: Change the process of how a question is asked by having the users decide who to ask first and then ask their question, in order to make the process of asking questions consistent throughout the experts app.
              </i></p>

              <li>Some users had difficulty locating the button to follow an expert (Low).
              </li>
              <p><i>Suggested Change: Add coach marks to educate users that experts can be saved and also add color to the “follow” button.
              </i></p>
              <br>
              <p>After addressing the top five issues found in the Usability Test Report, I made revisions to my old prototype and then received peer feedback on the improved prototype. With the feedback I received, I made additional revisions to my prototype.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</p>

            <h3>Preference Test</h3>
            <p>To improve the appearance of the expert app, a preference test was conducted on the home page using UsabilityHub.

           <h2><center>Key Learnings</center></h2>
           <br>
            <h4>People love Google.
            </h4>
            <p>Google is the best because it gives people autonomy, comfort, and convenience. People like to find answers on their own initiative and timing. Questions don't need to be fully thought out before completing a search. The search can be quick or more extensive, depending on the complexity of the question and what they are looking for.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>A free drink is not a strong incentive to complete a survey.
            </h4>
            <p>Providing an incentive of purchasing a drink for the participant after completion of the tasks isn't necessary since most of my participants did not mind completing the tasks. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Emphasis on building community can remove a professional feel. 
            </h4>
            <p>A social platform is created when everyone pitches in their opinion using casual and unfiltered language. Providing various perspectives can come in forms of bias or facts, and it's the facts that create professionalism while biased thoughts can create a social platform.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Swiping is a natural tendency when people are stuck on a screen.
            </h4>
            <p>When participants are not able to find what they are looking for or do not know how to proceed to the next step, their default mode is to swipe.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>The words "sign-in" and "sign-up" are too similar. 
            </h4>
            <p>I learned that most participants do not read carefully because the "sign-in" box was frequently clicked when creating an account instead of the "sign-up" box. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>A search icon on every screen is unnecessary and takes up space. 
            </h4>
            <p>I cannot understate the importance of having a search bar as participants naturally gravitate towards it to look up experts or questions. However, the search bar does not need to be on every screen as it may remove the focus off what is currently being displayed.
